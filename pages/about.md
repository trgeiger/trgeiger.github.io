I currently work as a web developer for the [Arts & Sciences](https://artsci.wustl.edu/) Computing team at my alma mater, Washington University in St. Louis. I help build, maintain, and improve over 40 Drupal websites for our various academic departments, from English Lit to Chemistry.

Some of the technologies that I use daily include PHP, HTML/CSS, JS, Linux, macOS, Apache, Git, and SQL&mdash;the full stack. I also have experience with Java, Python, Ruby, and C++. I'm always learning more.

Some of my *favorite* technologies and open source projects are [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop), [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and [(K)Ubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/).


I'm also a tech, lit, television, and game nerd.

Let me know if you want help on a project that helps people, particularly working class and underprivileged peoples.
