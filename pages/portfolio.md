Also per the design of my friend Jared, I created the personal site for music producer and mastering engineer Joel Nanos. The site uses a business card -inspired design, and showcases Joel's Twitter presence and examples of his producing work through Soundcloud.

## Pet Projects

Generates tweets every hour using Markov chains based on old tweets to generate natural-looking nonsense (no longer active, but you can look at old posts).
