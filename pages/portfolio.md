I currently work as a web developer for the Arts & Sciences Computing team at my alma mater, Washington University in St. Louis. I help build, maintain, and improve over 40 Drupal websites for our various academic departments, from English Lit to Chemistry.

Some of the technologies that I use daily include PHP, HTML/CSS, JS, Linux, macOS, Apache, Git, and SQL&mdash;the full stack.

I also have experience with Java, Python, Ruby, and C++. I'm always learning more.

Some of my *favorite* technologies and open source projects are Mozilla Firefox, KDE Plasma, Linux, (Neo)Vim, Arch Linux, and (K)Ubuntu.

You can see a few of my projects below. For a detailed breakdown of my work history, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/taylergeiger). Feel free to reach out there or by email.
