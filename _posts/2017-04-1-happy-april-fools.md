So I need some frigging posts on this page to see what it's gonna look like so I can format it the way I want. I think I'll probably start with making a mockup of what I think would look cool, then write the CSS and HTML to achieve the look of the mockup. This is how I'm told *real* designers craft front-end stuff&mdash;a designer hands the front-end coder a mockup and the coder makes the site look like the mockup.

I also want to figure out creating GitHub project sites so I can maybe showcase some working code in-browser, or at least create some sort of little showcase site for projects.

Lastly, I wish Google Gnome were real. That thing is super cute.
