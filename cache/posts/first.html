<p>This is a test post as I work on transferring (well, actually completely replacing) my old Jekyll site to the Nikola Python framework. Jekyll was working really well for me&mdash;as well as it could given that I barely did anything with the site&mdash;but I wanted to use a Python framework so I could mess with the innards if I wanted. Soon, I will get some professional docs up here, like my resume and some projects, maybe.</p>
